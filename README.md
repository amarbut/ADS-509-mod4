# Generative AI Chatbot
One of the most impactful applications of LLMs for data scientists is as a coding assistant/tool. In this assignment you will work with an AI Assistant of your choice to build a Data Science Chatbot. Remember that USD students all have access to Gemini Pro, though you should feel free to use whichever assistant you prefer. Since you will be working with an AI Assistant, this assignment notebook doesn't have the same kind of code scaffolding that previous assignments had, and your written questions will be largely reflections on your interactions with the AI Assistant. However, the general expectations are the same.


## Instructions

1. Create a repository under your GitHub account from this template: [https://github.com/amarbut/ADS-509-mod4](https://github.com/amarbut/ADS-509-mod4). Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Make your repository [private](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility) and add your instructorâ€™s GitHub account as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). 
2. Follow the provided Jupyter Notebook like a worksheet, completing all of the **TODO** items in the provided code cells and answering all of the written questions (marked **Q**) in the provided markdown cells. DO NOT create your own notebook or .py file from scratch, as this inevitably leads to missed instructions or questions and complicates grading.
3. When you have finished your code, print your notebook as a PDF and submit it in Canvas. 
4. Commit your code, push the changes to GitHub, and include a link to your repo in your Canvas submission note so your instructor has access to the .ipynb notebook files and any other code you create.
