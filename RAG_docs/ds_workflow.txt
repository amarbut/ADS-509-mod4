Title: Standard Data Science Workflow

Introduction:
Our data science team follows a structured workflow to ensure projects are reproducible, efficient, and aligned with business goals.

Steps:
1. Problem Definition
   - Clearly state the business question and success criteria.
   - Example: “Predict churn for subscription customers.”

2. Data Collection
   - Pull structured data from databases (PostgreSQL, Snowflake).
   - Gather unstructured data from APIs, logs, or surveys.

3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encodings.
   - Standardize feature scaling for machine learning.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Use pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to visualize distributions.
   - Identify correlations, trends, and anomalies.

5. Model Training
   - Start with baseline models (logistic regression, random forest).
   - Progress to more complex models (gradient boosting, neural nets).
   - Tools: scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch.

6. Model Evaluation
   - Metrics: accuracy, precision/recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC.
   - Use cross-validation for robustness.

7. Deployment & Monitoring
   - Package models in Docker and deploy via AWS SageMaker.
   - Track performance drift with MLflow.

Best Practices:
- Keep code modular and version controlled (GitHub).
- Document assumptions and preprocessing steps.
- Regularly update models as new data arrives.
