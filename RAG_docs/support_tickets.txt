Title: Accessing Customer Support Tickets in PostgreSQL

System Overview:
All inbound customer support tickets (from email, chat, and phone) are centralized in a PostgreSQL database. Each record contains metadata such as ticket ID, timestamp, customer ID, channel, priority, and free-text issue description.

Schema Example:

ticket_id     SERIAL      Unique ID for each support case
customer_id   INT         Foreign key to customer database
channel       VARCHAR     Email, chat, or phone
priority      VARCHAR     Low, Medium, High, Urgent
description   TEXT        Free-form text of customer issue
created_at    TIMESTAMP   When the ticket was logged
resolved_at   TIMESTAMP   When the ticket was closed

Usage Guidelines:
- Analysts can connect via psql or Pythonâ€™s psycopg2 library.
- Use parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection.
- Typical query:

SELECT ticket_id, description
FROM tickets
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
  AND priority = 'High';

Applications:
- Identify common complaint categories (e.g., login issues, billing errors).
- Train NLP models for automated triage.
- Feed unresolved tickets into the Data Science assistant bot for retrieval-augmented answers.

Notes:
- Data is refreshed in near real time.
- Tickets older than 2 years are archived to cold storage.
